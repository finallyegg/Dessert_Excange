now Rebuilding ||| A failed web_based shopping app

## Structure:
### Front End:
#### React.JS: Use ```UseEffect``` and ``` useStatus``` to fetch Auth, API data from ## AWS amplify

### Back End:
#### Amplify Framework, using amplify auth (that is AWS cognito User Pool) to build a login and password reset pipeline.
#### Amplify add api -- connect api with GraphQL in AWS AppSync

### PROBLEM
#### Each time I tried to add a new functionality, I have to run amplify push. Which caused great amount of error due to incorrect amplify configuration
#### and that means the learning curve is increased

## so as a result, I am going to abandon the amplify framework and handcraft the backend service from stratch. I will Update this readme regularly.
